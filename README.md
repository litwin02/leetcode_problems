## Introduction

LeetCode is a platform for improving coding and problem-solving skills by providing a wide range of algorithmic and data structure problems. This repository serves as a collection of my solutions to these challenges, written in Python.

## Structure

The solutions are stored as individual Python files, named after the exercise title, such as:
 - 13_roman_to_integer.py
 - 1768_merge_strings_alternately.py

Each file contains the Python solution for the corresponding problem.

## How to Use

To run a solution:
1. Locate the Python file that corresponds to the problem you're interested in.
2. Run the file using Python.

Example:

```bash
# Run the solution for the "Two Sum" problem
python 13_roman_to_integer.py
